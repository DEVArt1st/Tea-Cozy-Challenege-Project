# Tea Cozy Challenge Project

## Overview:
This was an off-platform project created by [Codecademy](https://www.codecademy.com/) made to help practice HTML and CSS skills, but the main focus was on CSS flexboxes. Inside of the project the reason for use of the CSS flexboxes was to fit the content neatly onto the webpage.

## Languages:
 - [x] HTML
 - [x] CSS
